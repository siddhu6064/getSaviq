## 5) Budgets / goals checks

- [ ] Deep link to add flow works from cold/warm start.
- [ ] Invalid deep links fail safely.

## 10) Profile-switch + restart-restore checks

## 11) iOS device checks

## 12) Android device checks

- [ ] Notification/deep-link flows validated on at least one recent Android version.

## 13) Dark mode checks

## 14) Performance/load-state checks

- [ ] Data corruption or cross-profile data leak.
- [ ] Broken create/edit/delete in transactions/budgets/goals.
- [ ] AI chat stuck in unrecoverable pending state.
- [ ] Notification/deep-link misrouting that blocks core tasks.

### Non-blockers (can defer with ticket)

- [ ] Minor spacing/typography polish nits.
- [ ] Small animation/perceived latency improvements without functional breakage.
- [ ] Optional observability enrichments beyond minimum launch baseline.
