# Mobile Parity Signoff (Web vs Mobile Final Audit)

Date: 2026-04-22  
Scope: final high-level parity audit using repository source of truth.

---

## 1) Web vs mobile route parity map

## Web routes (from `web/src/App.jsx`)

- `/` Dashboard
- `/transactions`
- `/analytics`
- `/budgets`
- `/goals`
- `/settings`
- `/export`
- `/login`

## Mobile routes (from `frontend/app/(tabs)` + root)

- `/(tabs)/index` Dashboard
- `/(tabs)/transactions`
- `/(tabs)/stats` (Analytics)
- `/(tabs)/budgets`
- `/(tabs)/goals`
- `/(tabs)/more` (settings/export/profile controls)
- `/` (auth/entry)
- plus mobile-only utilities (`/(tabs)/add`, `/(tabs)/accounts`)

Assessment:

- Primary route parity is present for core user journeys.
- Naming differs (`stats` vs `analytics`, `more` grouping settings/export), but capability mapping is preserved.

## 2) Feature parity status (final)

| Area                                             | Parity status           | Severity | Notes                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dashboard core                                   | Complete                |      Low | Core dashboard path and intelligence surfaces present.                             |
| Transactions                                     | Complete (primary flow) |      Low | List + subviews + CRUD pathways are implemented.                                   |
| Budgets                                          | Complete (primary flow) |      Low | Create/edit/delete and progress surfaces present.                                  |
| Goals                                            | Complete (primary flow) |      Low | Create/edit/delete and projection/milestone surfaces present.                      |
| Analytics                                        | Complete (primary flow) |      Low | Summary + breakdown + trend sections present.                                      |
| AI chat capabilities                             | Complete (primary flow) |      Low | Open/submit/retry + persisted restore semantics implemented.                       |
| Profile switching + restart restore              | Near-complete           |   Medium | Implemented in code paths; requires final real-device confirmation.                |
| Empty/error/loading states                       | Near-complete           |   Medium | Broadly implemented; final runtime edge pass still device-dependent.               |
| Notifications/deep-links                         | Near-complete           |   Medium | Implemented routes/handlers; cold/warm execution still requires device validation. |
| Observability (analytics/crash telemetry parity) | Partial                 |     High | Event/crash parity baseline not yet equivalent; tracked as operational delta.      |

---

## 3) Remaining deltas

1. **Observability parity is partial** (no complete mobile event telemetry + crash sink baseline).
   - Impact: weaker beta diagnostics and rollout confidence.
   - Severity: High.

2. **Device-only execution gaps remain** for notification/deep-link and perceived performance.
   - Impact: runtime behavior confidence incomplete without TestFlight/internal Android runs.
   - Severity: Medium.

---

## 4) Final recommendation

- **Parity verdict:** **Near-complete** for functional product parity; not full operational parity yet due to observability gap.
- **Rollout recommendation:**
  - ✅ Ready for **internal beta** after real-device checklist execution.
  - ⚠️ Hold **wider rollout** until:
    1. minimum mobile observability baseline is in place, and
    2. TestFlight + Android internal checklist passes are signed off.
