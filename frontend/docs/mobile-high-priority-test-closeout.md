# Mobile High-Priority Test Closeout

Date: 2026-04-22

## Scope

This pass targets **highest-priority mobile gaps only** using the existing lightweight helper/state test approach (no new heavy UI test framework introduced).

## What is now covered

### A) Auth route guard coverage

Added deterministic guard/deep-link route decision tests:

- `frontend/src/utils/authRouteGuardState.test.mjs`

Covered behaviors:

- unauthenticated users are forced out of protected tabs (`leave_tabs`)
- authenticated users enter tabs from public routes (`enter_tabs`)
- loading-phase navigation waits (`wait`) to avoid auth-race churn
- deep-link route assumptions are normalized for:
  - `/(tabs)/add`
  - `/(tabs)/stats` (`stats` / `analytics` alias)
  - `/(tabs)` (`home` / `dashboard`)

Implementation wiring:

- `frontend/app/_layout.tsx` now uses `deriveAuthRouteAction` and `deriveDeepLinkNavigationTarget`.

### B) Transactions screen integration-adjacent coverage

Expanded orchestration tests around real screen flow helpers:

- updated `frontend/src/utils/transactionFlowState.test.mjs`

Covered behaviors:

- create/edit/delete transaction list transitions
- month + search composition via `deriveVisibleTransactions`
- empty-results safety
- swipe action handler wiring identity (`press`/`edit`/`delete` callbacks stay bound to selected row)

Implementation wiring:

- `frontend/app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` now uses `deriveVisibleTransactions` and `buildTransactionRowHandlers`.

### C) Budgets screen integration-adjacent coverage

Expanded budgets screen-state coverage:

- updated `frontend/src/utils/budgetsScreenState.test.mjs`

Covered behaviors:

- loading/no-profile/ready states
- create vs edit save mode
- modal title transitions for create/edit/category/total modes
- delete orchestration for total vs category budgets
- profile-aware refresh trigger behavior

Implementation wiring:

- `frontend/app/(tabs)/budgets.tsx` now uses:
  - `deriveBudgetSaveMode`
  - `deriveBudgetModalTitle`
  - `removeBudgetFromProgress`
  - `shouldReloadBudgetsForProfileChange`

### D) Goals screen integration-adjacent coverage

Expanded goals screen-state coverage:

- updated `frontend/src/utils/goalsScreenState.test.mjs`

Covered behaviors:

- loading/no-profile/error/empty/ready states
- create vs edit save mode
- modal title transitions
- delete orchestration behavior
- profile-aware reload trigger behavior

Implementation wiring:

- `frontend/app/(tabs)/goals.tsx` now uses:
  - `deriveGoalSaveMode`
  - `deriveGoalModalTitle`
  - `removeGoalById`
  - `shouldReloadGoalsForProfileChange`

### E) AI chat modal integration-adjacent coverage

Added chat-modal orchestration helper tests:

- `frontend/src/utils/aiChatModalState.test.mjs`

Covered behaviors:

- empty modal + suggestion to composer
- submit disable and send precondition logic
- close/reopen interruption handling for retry-capable state
- profile isolation-safe untouched session behavior

Implementation wiring:

- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/AIInsightsChatModal.tsx` now uses:
  - `deriveIsChatSubmitDisabled`
  - `applyChatSuggestion`
  - `buildChatSendQuestionParams`
  - `deriveChatSessionOnModalClose`

### F) Deep-link / notification / restart support

Added pure route mapping tests:

- `frontend/src/utils/notificationRouteState.test.mjs`

Covered route assumptions:

- `/(tabs)/add`
- `/(tabs)/stats` (including `analytics` alias)
- `/(tabs)` (home/dashboard)

Implementation wiring:

- `frontend/src/services/notificationService.ts` now delegates route mapping to `deriveRouteFromNotificationData`.

Restart validation support:

- Existing `aiChatSessionState` + new `aiChatModalState` tests cover interrupted-pending degradation into retry-capable failed state.

## What remains manual/device-only after this pass

- True React Native render-tree interaction assertions (tap gestures, animation responsiveness, keyboard overlap behavior).
- Push-notification runtime behavior on real devices (foreground/background/cold-start timing nuances).
- Deep-link and notification behavior across device lifecycle transitions (OS kill/restart edge timing).
- Full visual/dark-mode contrast verification on real devices.

## What still remains missing

- Full RN component/integration/e2e automation for tab screens (transactions/budgets/goals/dashboard) with real mounted views.
- Device-level end-to-end validation framework (Detox/Maestro/Appium) if launch criteria require full runtime automation beyond helper/state guarantees.

## Notes

This pass intentionally maximizes high-signal deterministic coverage while avoiding broad architecture churn.
