# Mobile Runtime Validation Report (Final Device-Sensitive Pass)

Date: 2026-04-22
Scope: mobile-only (`frontend/`) runtime/device risk closeout.

## Execution reality

This environment cannot run iOS Simulator/TestFlight or physical Android devices.

Therefore this report uses four evidence types only:

1. **Static inspection** of runtime paths,
2. **Existing helper/state tests**,
3. **Prior closeout docs/checklists**,
4. **No direct device execution** in this pass.

Status legend:

- **Passed**: evidence includes real runtime/device execution for the item.
- **Failed**: runtime/device execution found a concrete failure.
- **Not Tested**: no meaningful evidence available.
- **Needs Real Device Confirmation**: partial confidence from static/tests/docs, but runtime/device behavior remains unproven.

| 1   | Auth + guest entry                                      | Needs Real Device Confirmation | static inspection + auth guard helper tests + prior reports                | Route-guard logic and transitions are tested at helper level, but end-to-end auth/guest runtime flow remains device-unverified.                         |
| 2   | Dashboard load / refresh / profile switch               | Needs Real Device Confirmation | helper/state tests + prior docs                                            | Deterministic state guards exist; actual device refresh smoothness and profile-switch UX still require runtime confirmation.                            |
| 3   | Transactions create / edit / delete / swipe             | Needs Real Device Confirmation | transaction flow helper tests + prior docs                                 | CRUD/screen-state orchestration is covered in helper tests; gesture reliability and full runtime wiring still need device walkthrough.                  |
| 4   | Budgets create / edit / delete                          | Needs Real Device Confirmation | budget screen-state tests + prior docs                                     | Create/edit/delete branching and profile-aware state are helper-tested; final runtime form interactions remain device-dependent.                        |

| 8   | Weekly Digest + Subscription widgets                    | Needs Real Device Confirmation | intelligence/helper tests + prior docs                                     | State mapping and widget logic are covered; real device rendering/refresh/perf remains unverified.                                                      |
| 9   | Deep-link / notification routing                        | Needs Real Device Confirmation | route-mapping helper tests + static layout/service inspection + prior docs | Mapping assumptions are deterministic in tests (`/(tabs)/add`, `/(tabs)/stats`, `/(tabs)`), but push/deep-link cold/warm runtime timing is device-only. |

| 11  | Dark mode on primary flows                              | Needs Real Device Confirmation | prior theme validation doc + static inspection                             | Theme coverage was audited previously; final device contrast/readability pass still required.                                                           |

## Blockers (for broader rollout)

1. **Device runtime validation is incomplete** across iOS and Android for core flows (auth, CRUD, widgets, deep-link/notification, restart restore, dark mode).
2. **Deep-link/notification and process-kill restore remain unproven in real runtime**, despite good helper/static evidence.

## Non-blockers (for limited internal beta)

- Minor visual polish/perceived-latency improvements that do not affect correctness.
- Additional telemetry enrichment beyond minimum operational baseline.

---

## Final recommendation

- **Ready for internal beta** only after targeted real-device execution and sign-off of the open checklist items.
- **Not ready for broader rollout** yet.
- Required next step: execute `frontend/docs/mobile-beta-readiness-checklist.md` on at least one recent iOS device and one recent Android device, then update this report with true runtime outcomes.
