# Mobile Beta Validation Report (TestFlight + Internal Android)

Date: 2026-04-22  
Source checklist: `frontend/docs/mobile-beta-readiness-checklist.md`

## 1) Execution scope

This environment does **not** provide TestFlight or physical Android device execution.

Therefore this report separates:

- **Actually executed here** (static inspection + existing automated tests), and
- **Requires real device/beta execution** (marked Not Tested).

## 2) Results by checklist area

| Area                                       | Status           | Evidence / notes                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Install + launch (iOS/Android beta builds) | Not Tested       | Requires TestFlight/internal distribution installs on physical devices.                                                         |
| Auth / guest flow                          | Partially Tested | Static code path inspection only; no device runtime auth session exercised in this environment.                                 |
| Dashboard + widgets                        | Partially Tested | Static render/load-state logic reviewed; no runtime gesture/perf validation on device.                                          |
| Transactions CRUD                          | Partially Tested | Static flow/path checks only; no live backend/device CRUD run.                                                                  |
| Budgets CRUD                               | Partially Tested | Static code inspection only.                                                                                                    |
| Goals CRUD                                 | Partially Tested | Static code inspection only.                                                                                                    |
| Analytics screen                           | Partially Tested | Static view-state and chart interaction code reviewed.                                                                          |
| AI chat send/retry/restore                 | Partially Tested | Utility test coverage exists for chat state transitions; no device runtime chat session execution in this environment.          |
| Notifications/deep-links (cold + warm)     | Not Tested       | Requires push/deep-link trigger on physical devices.                                                                            |
| Profile switching                          | Partially Tested | Static state reset/flow logic inspected; no runtime multi-profile device walkthrough.                                           |
| Restart restore                            | Partially Tested | Utility/state handling covered in tests for persisted chat sanitization; full app kill/reopen path not executed on device here. |
| Dark mode                                  | Partially Tested | Prior static parity/theming pass complete; no final device visual pass in this environment.                                     |
| Performance perception                     | Not Tested       | Requires real device perception checks (animations, keyboard/modals, low-end devices).                                          |

## 3) Automated/static checks executed in this phase

- Existing utility tests were re-run for AI session and intelligence state helpers (pass).
- Repo/static inspections were used for checklist mapping and parity verification.

---

## 4) Blockers vs non-blockers (current signoff state)

## Blockers (for broad rollout)

1. **Real device beta execution not completed** for TestFlight and internal Android across the full checklist.
2. **Observability parity remains partial** (analytics event coverage and crash tracking are not yet at parity baseline).

## Non-blockers (for limited internal beta)

- Minor visual/interaction polish items that do not break core functionality.
- Optional telemetry enrichment beyond minimum launch instrumentation baseline.

---

## 5) Release recommendation

- **Ready for limited internal beta only**, contingent on executing the checklist on real iOS/Android devices.
- **Not yet ready for wider rollout** until:
  1. real device checklist execution is completed and signed off, and
  2. minimum mobile observability baseline is implemented.
