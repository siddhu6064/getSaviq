# Mobile + Web Test Coverage Reality Check (Repo-Grounded)

Date: 2026-04-22

## Bottom-line answer

- **Do we have all mobile test cases?** **No.** Mobile currently has strong helper/state unit coverage, but lacks meaningful automated component/integration/e2e coverage for core user flows in `frontend/app/*`.
- **Do we have all web test cases?** **No.** Web has strong helper/state coverage and substantial Playwright e2e coverage, but still has clear gaps in route-level/component-level coverage for some surfaces (notably goals and some settings/auth permutations).
- **Highest-priority missing tests before broader rollout:** mobile screen-level integration (transactions/budgets/goals/dashboard + auth/profile/lifecycle), mobile deep-link/notification/restart automation where feasible, and web route-level coverage for under-tested surfaces (especially goals/auth permutations).

## Scope + method used

This audit used the actual SAVIQ structure:

- Backend: `backend/`
- Mobile: `frontend/`
- Web: `web/`
- Cross-app tests: `tests/`

Patterns searched:

- `*.test.*`
- `*.spec.*`
- Playwright config/spec usage
- test-framework markers in repo scripts and test files

---

## 1) Inventory of existing tests (by platform + level)

## Mobile (`frontend/`)

### Helper/unit tests (present)

All visible mobile automated tests are utility/state-level tests under `frontend/src/utils/*.test.mjs`:

- AI chat state/persistence sanitization: `aiChatSessionState.test.mjs`
- Dashboard intelligence state mapping: `aiIntelligenceState.test.mjs`
- Analytics screen state sanitization: `analyticsScreenState.test.mjs`
- Budget form + screen state helpers: `budgetFormState.test.mjs`, `budgetsScreenState.test.mjs`
- Goals form/projection/milestones/screen state: `goalsFormState.test.mjs`, `goalsProjectionState.test.mjs`, `goalsMilestones.test.mjs`, `goalsScreenState.test.mjs`
- Smart metrics cards + section state: `smartMetricsCards.test.mjs`, `smartMetricsSectionState.test.mjs`
- Transaction create/edit/filter/retry state helpers: `transactionFlowState.test.mjs`, `transactionRetryState.test.mjs`

### Component tests (missing)

- No React Native component test suite found (no RTL/Jest screen/component test files in `frontend/`).

### Integration tests (missing)

- No mobile integration harness found that mounts `frontend/app/(tabs)` screens and asserts end-to-end screen behavior.

### E2E tests (missing)

- No mobile Detox/Appium/Maestro-style e2e suite found.

### Manual/device-only evidence (present)

Mobile docs explicitly call out runtime/device-only checks remaining for:

- deep links + notifications,
- restart/restore and lifecycle behavior,
- real-device visual/performance/theme verification.

## Web (`web/` + `tests/e2e`)

### Helper/unit tests (present)

Web helper/state/presentation tests exist under `web/src/lib/*.test.mjs`, including:

- AI chat state (`aiInsightsChatState.test.mjs`)
- Forecast state/presentation
- Goals validation/presentation/feedback
- Smart metrics section/presentation/dashboard state
- Weekly digest banner/card/presentation/dashboard state + banner analytics
- Subscriptions presentation/card state

### Component tests (limited/missing explicit suite)

- No dedicated React Testing Library/Vitest/Jest component test suite found for `web/src/components/*` or `web/src/pages/*`.

### Integration/E2E tests (present)

- Playwright is configured (`playwright.config.ts`) and a large e2e suite exists at `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`.
- Despite filename `smoke`, it contains extensive dashboard/transactions/analytics/budgets/subscriptions/weekly-digest/smart-metrics/AI-chat scenarios and profile-switch stability checks.

### Manual-only areas

- Fewer explicit manual-only constraints than mobile, but browser/device matrix breadth is still outside the single Playwright project (`chromium`) currently configured.

## Backend tests (only parity-relevant mention)

Parity-adjacent backend tests exist in `tests/backend/` for AI insights/chat, dashboard metrics, weekly digest, subscriptions summary, savings goals, and forecast APIs/services. These support API confidence but **do not replace mobile/web UI coverage**.

## 2) Coverage by feature area (helper vs UI vs integration/e2e vs manual)

| Feature area                   | Mobile status                                       | Web status                                                  | Evidence-backed read                                                                                                             |

| Analytics                      | **Helper-only**                                     | **E2E present**                                             | Mobile analytics helper tests only; web e2e validates analytics success + failure states.                                        |
| Weekly digest                  | **Helper mapping via intelligence helpers**         | **Strong helper + e2e**                                     | Mobile covered via intelligence state tests; web has dedicated weekly digest lib + e2e coverage.                                 |

## 3) Precise missing-test checklist (source of truth)

Legend:

- Existing coverage explicitly separates helper/unit from UI/integration/e2e.
- Priority: blocker / high / medium / low.

## 4) Implemented surfaces vs current automated coverage

### Mobile implemented surfaces reviewed

- `frontend/app/(tabs)`: dashboard (`index.tsx`), transactions, stats, budgets, goals, more, add, accounts, tab layout.
- `frontend/app/_layout.tsx`: auth gating, deep-link handling, notification response routing, pending deep-link behavior.
- `frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`: runtime theme token provider.

Coverage reality:

- Automated tests target `frontend/src/utils/*` helper logic.
- No comparable automation found that mounts these actual route screens/components.
- Therefore parity confidence remains helper-centric, not full UX-centric.

### Web implemented surfaces reviewed

- `web/src/App.jsx` routes: `/`, `/transactions`, `/analytics`, `/settings`, `/budgets`, `/goals`, `/export`, `/login`.
- `web/src/pages/*` and dashboard components.

Coverage reality:

- Helper/state coverage in `web/src/lib/*.test.mjs` is strong.
- Integration/e2e via Playwright is extensive, especially dashboard + smart metrics + subscriptions + weekly digest + AI chat modal + key transactions flows.
- Remaining gap is uneven route-depth (not all pages/edge permutations covered equally).

---

## Final rollout guidance

- **Mobile is not fully covered** for broader rollout until screen-level integration plus lifecycle/device-critical validations are automated or elevated to strict manual gates.
- **Web is closer but not complete**: dashboard-heavy and transaction flows are strong; goals/auth/settings edge depth and browser-matrix breadth remain the highest-value additions.
