**Financial intelligence for modern households and solo operators.**  
SAVIQ combines transaction tracking, forecasting, savings planning, and AI guidance across web and mobile in one profile-aware platform.

> **Current posture:** feature-complete for internal beta, with remaining runtime/device validation and observability work before broader rollout.

## Why SAVIQ

Most expense apps answer **“what happened?”**. SAVIQ is designed to answer:

- **What is happening now?** (real-time spend visibility)
- **What is likely next?** (forecasting + budget risk)
- **What should I do?** (AI recommendations and guided savings)

SAVIQ exists to help users make confident financial decisions, not just log transactions.

## Core Differentiators

- **AI-native financial UX:** conversational and card-based insights integrated directly into product flows.
- **Forecast + action loop:** projections, confidence scoring, and recommendation layers tied to savings goals and budget posture.
- **Cross-platform continuity:** web and Expo mobile surfaces cover the same core financial workflows.
- **Profile-aware data boundaries:** personal/business/shared profile contexts with explicit scoped rendering and data access.

---

## Feature Highlights

### 1) Financial Dashboard & Smart Metrics

- Net balance, income, spend, month-over-month movement, top goal summary.
- Smart metrics including savings score, spend velocity, financial health, budget confidence, and projected savings.
- Loading/empty/error state handling across dashboard cards and widgets.

### 2) Goals, Budgets, and Planning

- Savings goals CRUD with progress, milestones, projected completion dates, and monthly recommendation support.
- Budget tracking with risk-oriented visibility and profile-aware filtering.
- Priority goal surfacing from dashboard context.

### 3) Forecasting & Risk Intelligence

- 7-day and 30-day projection windows.
- Month-end spend forecasting and velocity modeling.
- Budget exceed risk and confidence scoring with plain-language explanation layers.

### 4) AI-Powered Intelligence

- Smart insights and recommendations on dashboard surfaces.
- AI receipt scanning endpoint support.
- AI chat insights (`/ai/chat-insights`) with prompt suggestions, retry/failure handling, and profile-isolated conversation context.

### 5) Weekly Digest & Recurring Spend Detection

- Weekly financial digest with narrative summary, income/expense delta, and profile switching support.
- Recurring spend detection with subscription candidates and monthly recurring totals.

### 6) Exports

- Data export endpoints for CSV and JSON scoped by profile/date windows.

### 7) Mobile Coverage

- Route-level coverage across dashboard, transactions, budgets, goals, analytics, and AI chat flows.
- Mobile-first interaction patterns, dark mode support for primary flows, and profile switching restore behavior.

## Profile Model (Current Scope)

SAVIQ supports profile switching with explicit `profile_type` values:

- `personal`
- `business`
- `shared`

Important scope boundary:

- `business` currently represents profile context and data partitioning, **not** a full multi-user organization account model.
- Ownership remains single-user scoped per authenticated account.
- Team memberships, invitations, shared ownership, and role-based org collaboration are not implemented yet.

## Architecture Overview

| Layer        | Stack                                    | Notes                                                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Backend API  | Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, Motor/PyMongo | Session/auth flows, profile-scoped data model, analytics/forecast/AI endpoints |
| Database     | MongoDB                                  | Collections + startup index initialization (including TTL on sessions)         |
| Web App      | React + Vite, Tailwind, Recharts         | Product UI, dashboards, goals, analytics, exports, AI chat                     |
| Mobile App   | React Native (Expo)                      | Cross-platform mobile experience with backend auth integration                 |
| Shared Logic | `shared/` TypeScript package             | Shared constants/types/utils across app surfaces                               |
| Testing      | `pytest`, `node:test`, Playwright        | Backend coverage + web logic/E2E + mobile helper/orchestration tests           |

## AI Stack and Degradation Behavior

### Primary dependency

- OpenAI integration is wired via backend service layer and environment configuration.

### Optionality

- AI-specific configuration is optional for core CRUD and analytics flows.
- If AI is unavailable or disabled, core expense tracking, budgets, goals, and non-AI analytics remain available.

### Feature control

- `ENABLE_AI_FEATURES` can be used to gate AI behavior by environment.
- OpenAI model/runtime values are configured via backend environment variables.

---

## Environment Setup

> ⚠️ **Important:** Backend runtime loads env from `backend/.env` (not only repo root). Copy from `backend/.env.example`.

### Minimum required variables (core backend persistence)

```env
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
DB_NAME=expense_tracker
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:8081
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_long_random_secret
```

### Client connectivity variables

- Web: `VITE_BACKEND_URL` (recommended; production build expects this outside localhost).
- Mobile (Expo): `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`.

### Optional integrations

- OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, model vars) for AI features.
- Google/Apple auth for social login endpoints.
- Telemetry providers (Sentry/PostHog) and additional infrastructure integrations are scaffolded in env templates but not required for core local operation.

---

## Local Development

### 1) Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

### 2) Web

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3) Mobile (Expo)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` to a backend URL reachable from your emulator/device.

---

## Testing

### Backend

```bash
pytest
```

### Web logic tests

```bash
node --test web/src/lib/*.test.mjs
```

### Web E2E (smoke/core flows)

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Build checks

```bash
cd web && npm run build
```

## Mobile & Runtime Notes

- Automated mobile coverage currently emphasizes high-signal helper/state/orchestration logic.
- Full mobile UI E2E/device-matrix validation is intentionally not yet exhaustive.
- Additional runtime validation remains necessary for:
  - gesture behavior
  - lifecycle handling
  - deep links
  - notifications

This is the primary remaining validation gap between internal beta and wider rollout confidence.

## Release Readiness

| Area                       | Status                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature scope (V2)         | ✅ Complete                                       |
| Web + mobile route parity  | ✅ Complete                                       |
| Backend/API implementation | ✅ Complete for core flows                        |
| Automated tests            | ✅ Strong (backend + web + targeted mobile logic) |
| Device/runtime validation  | ⛔ Pending final pass                             |
| Observability hardening    | ⚠️ Minimal / in progress                          |

**Current release posture:** ready for **internal beta** and controlled usage; not yet positioned as broad production rollout.

---

## Roadmap (Near-Term)

1. **Observability hardening**
   - Crash tracking and key analytics instrumentation.
2. **Export expansion**
   - PDF export support to complement CSV/JSON.
3. **Device/runtime confidence**
   - Broader on-device validation across lifecycle/deep-link/notification scenarios.
4. **Collaboration & business profile evolution**
   - Team/org primitives (roles, memberships, invitations, shared ownership).

---

SAVIQ is already a strong internal-beta product baseline: feature-complete, cross-platform, and AI-augmented. The remaining work is operational hardening and runtime validation for larger-scale rollout.
